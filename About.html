                    Heya, this is Paige. I love making things. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A few years ago after graduating from both university and college I thought I had stumbled across my forever career. I was a custom technician for a wheelchair company (life takes you strange places). I designed custom solutions- often working in a machine shop- drilling, cutting, bolting, industrial sewing, CNC machining, you name it. It was so rewarding, helping disabled people and building things every day. It was also extremely physical and really aggravated my chronic back pain, so I needed a new path. It was with tears that I left my workshop days in the past in 2019.
                    I still loved making things. How could I make things without the physicality?
The answer was digitally. I wasn’t afraid to learn a bunch of new things. I love learning.
Though I have a natural aptitude for drawing, design and even writing- I also have a keen interest in psychology- my university degree was a Bsc. In Psychology from McMaster University. How do we perceive the world around us? What motivates people?
Cue the new field of “UX design” that combines two of my passions- psychology and MAKING THINGS!

                    How can we make digital assets and experiences to help people feel a certain way? How can we make interactions with machines more intuitive? 
                    Currently I am working part time towards a UX certificate from York University while at the same time immersing in digital design tools. I had some experience with content creation, recording and web design from working at a radio station in University, so I went from there and began to immerse myself in the Adobe suite. I started projects making videos and animations with After Effects and Premiere. I illustrated some old comics I had drawn. I illustrated a short story that I wrote that was actually published. I made some logos pro-bono for some friends. I learned Bootstrap and made a website. Here we are.
